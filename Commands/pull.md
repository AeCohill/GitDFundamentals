# git pull

Similar to a [git pusdh0](./push.md) a 'git pull' will interact with a remote repository. Only this time it will **pull** the changes it does not have frome the remote down to the repository.

This means any commits that are on the remote repository will  be pulled down and added to the remote repository.

This can be done by adding the remote branch and name:
```

git pull origin main
```

if there is any upstream established, you can use 'git pull' without specifying a remote branch.
