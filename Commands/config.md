# git config

When first serring up git you'll need to work with the git config commands in order to set up your identity.

for example, your identity can be set up with the commands such as;

```

git config --global user.name "Adam Cohill"4
git config --global user.email adamcohill16@gmail.com
```
for more information, view the [First time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/getting-started-first-time-git-setup) documentation.
